# [Lerman.theboy Website](http://davideperucchini.github.io)
**[Lerman.theboy Website](http://davideperucchini.github.io)** is my first personal website project. I tried to design a fresh interface that was intuitive at the same time. In conclusion, I did this by following my personal taste and trying to express my mood.
